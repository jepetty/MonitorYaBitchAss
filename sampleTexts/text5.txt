Hello I just wanted to send some love and good vibes to you!! Happy birthday, my dear friend!! I hope you have an absolutely incredible day, and that the journey up to Montana went smoothly. All my best wishes for you and your family, and hope your visit with your brother is fantastic. I’m going to be cheesy with you (because it’s your birthday, right, you deserve to feel appreciated?) and tell you how truly grateful I am for your friendship. I can’t tell you the number of times I feel like I’m a hopeless case, doomed to repeat my patterns of destruction, and every time I think of your friendship and get so much peace. So thank you very much for the last couple years of friendship, and on your birthday I must say I look forward to many more! I know you probably never will want to, but if you ever want a wingman to go out to the bars with you, well I’m your gal. ;) Happy birthday again, my friend! I hope you have a wonderful break!!
