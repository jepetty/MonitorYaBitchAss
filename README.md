# MonitorYaBitchAss
Web application created in collaboration for the second annual HackCU. 
## Description
Alright, listen up you realest folks that find yourself at our repository. We're a group of down-ass homies who loving chilling together and coding up a storm. Our vision for this hackathon included an epic app to stop you from ever sending a text you'll regret. We would conquer Apple's security firewalls better than the American government. But, alas, we were in a little over our heads. 

Instead, we bring you this wicked awesome web application!! It uses IBM Watson's tone analysis API to analyze the overall emotional tone of a text a lost soul inputs for our spiritual guidance. We believe it will provide learning, enlightenment, and personal self control for many drunk and pining college students.
