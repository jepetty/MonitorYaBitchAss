# MonitorYaBitchAss
Text-messaging monitor app created for CU Hackathon
##To do/consider
- [ ] Create android keyboard
    - [ ] Button
    - [ ] Take contents
    - [ ] Fly my pretties to Watson (must)
- [ ] Categorize recipients into groups
- [ ] Set of conditions that warrant pop-up (must)
    - Based off of results of Watson
    - [ ] Pop-up needs to look pretty
    - [ ] Should include food
- [ ] Takes into account time of day (stretch)
- [ ] Go to IBM Watson -> return sentiment
## Order of Operations:
1. Figure out how to make an android keyboard
2. Investigate interacting with IBM Watson
3. Someone chugging away on UI
    Include messages that a person gets (What kind of warning are we sharing with them?)
